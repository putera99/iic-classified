                    <h4>GIANT KHAN Bicycle (now inc. photo!!)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Due to your many requests, I have now added a photo. The golf clubs aren't 
                        included!! I'm leaving Shanghai, so I'm selling my 1 Year old Giant Khan with 
                        wheel lock, ch	ain lock and basket. It is the 'male' model (with top straight bar frame).
                    </p>
                    <h4>500 RMB O.N.O. (or near offer)</h4>
                    <p>
                        It's in perfect condition and a dream to cruise around Shanghai on
                        (they say only those who've ridden a KHAN know the feeling...i think...)
                        If you've seen one, you've seen them all. Give me a call if you want to know more!
